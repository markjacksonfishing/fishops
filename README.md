Welcome to markjacksonfishing's script hub: a collection of diverse, practical scripts for tech enthusiasts. From automation to environment setups and data analysis, dive into my world where code meets everyday challenges.

## What's Inside

This repository is a home for scripts that I've created or collected over time. They range from simple automation tasks to more complex setups for development environments. I am in the process of adding them where possible. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what you can find soon:

- **Automation Scripts**: Automate repetitive tasks and save time.
- **Environment Setups**: Quickly set up development environments for various projects.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Dive into data with easy-to-use scripts.
