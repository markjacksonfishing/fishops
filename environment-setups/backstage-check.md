# The Great Backstage Prerequisite Adventure

There I was, in the serene embrace of nature, surrounded by the tranquil waters that promised a bountiful catch. Yet, as any seasoned angler knows, the true catch of the day wasn't just the bass lurking beneath the surface—it was the peace of mind found in the simplicity of fishing. But this tale isn't just about fishing; it's about embarking on a digital adventure to set up Spotify Backstage, armed with nothing but a trusty shell script and a keen sense of humor.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Checking system prerequisites for Spotify Backstage..."
```
Ah, the familiar echo of preparation. Like checking the weather before a fishing trip, ensuring the right conditions for Spotify Backstage felt oddly similar.


```bash
# Check Operating System
os_type=$(uname)
echo "Operating System: $os_type"
```
Just as I would choose a lake for its water clarity and vegetation, choosing the right operating system was crucial. Was I casting my line in the murky waters of Windows, the flowing rivers of MacOS, or the vast ocean that is Linux?


```bash
# Check for GNU-like build environment
echo "Checking for GNU-like build environment..."
if command -v make >/dev/null && (command -v gcc >/dev/null || command -v clang >/dev/null); then
    echo "Build tools are available."
else
    echo "Build tools (make and gcc/clang) are missing."
fi
```
In fishing, having the right gear—rods, reels, lures—is essential. Similarly, not having make or gcc/clang was like forgetting my tackle box at home. A rookie mistake!


```bash
# Elevated rights - This is more advisory, as a script cannot easily determine if it has rights to install dependencies
echo "Ensure you have elevated rights to install dependencies."
```
Ah, elevated rights. The digital equivalent of having permission to fish in private waters. Did I have the key to the gate, or was I stuck peering through the fence?


```bash
# Check for curl or wget
echo "Checking for curl or wget..."
if command -v curl >/dev/null || command -v wget >/dev/null; then
    echo "curl or wget is installed."
else
    echo "curl and wget are missing."
fi
```
Curl or wget? Essential tools for fetching, much like choosing between baitcasting or spinning reels. Each has its place in the angler's boat—or in this case, the developer's toolkit.

```bash
# Node.js and nvm check
echo "Checking for Node.js..."
if command -v nvm >/dev/null; then
    echo "nvm is installed."
    node_version=$(nvm current)
    echo "Node.js version: ${node_version}"
elif command -v node >/dev/null; then
    node_version=$(node -v)
    echo "Node.js is installed directly without nvm: ${node_version}"
else
    echo "Node.js is missing. nvm is recommended for managing Node.js versions."
fi
```
Navigating the waters of Node.js versions without nvm was like trying to fish without a net—possible, but perilously imprudent.


```bash
# Check for yarn
echo "Checking for Yarn..."
if command -v yarn >/dev/null; then
    echo "Yarn is installed: ${yarn_version}"
else
    echo "Yarn is missing."
fi
```
Yarn, the line that ties the project together, ensuring that all dependencies are snugly hooked and ready for deployment.

```bash

# Check for Docker
echo "Checking for Docker..."
if command -v docker >/dev/null; then
    echo "Docker is installed."
else
    echo "Docker is missing."
fi
```
Ah, Docker. The cooler that keeps our environment consistent and our deployment fresh. Without it, we're just casting lines in a barren stream.


```bash
# Check for Git
echo "Checking for Git..."
if command -v git >/dev/null; then
    echo "Git is installed."
else
    echo "Git is missing."
fi
```
And Git, the trusty tackle box where all our precious code is stored. Without it, we're merely telling tales of "the one that got away."


```bash
# Function to check open ports
check_port() {
    local port=$1
    if lsof -i:"$port" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "Port $port is open."
    else
        echo "Port $port is not open or in use."
    fi
}
```

Checking ports felt akin to finding the perfect fishing spot. Port 3000, much like my favorite secluded nook, needed to be open and free from the hustle and bustle of other network traffic.

And so, with each line of code, I ventured deeper into the wilderness of technology, casting my script into the digital river. Each check was a stroke of the oar, each echo a ripple in the water. As the script concluded, I found myself not just closer to deploying Spotify Backstage but reminded of the tranquility found in the methodical nature of both coding and fishing.

Who knew that in the quest for setting up a development environment, I'd find a peacefulness akin to that on the water's edge at dawn, rod in hand, waiting for the bass to bite?
